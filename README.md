## My Project
This is a project inspired by a video and from my love for sudokus. I thought it would be fun to solve a sudoku in another way than usually.
I solved it by using backtracking and recursiveness.  
The instructions can be seen when opening my site here: https://alexjs6.github.io/Sudoku_Solver_algorithm/.
